# Employee Front Page

## Description

The reason behind this application is to build a portfolio for myself to allow possible eomployers to view my previous works. 

## Installation

When downloaded from github, the package.json will already be prepared. All that needs to be done is run the integrated terminal in the Develop Folder and enter
```npm i```
This will download the library necessary to run the program.

to start the react app on localhost run ```npm run start```

## Viewing

- On page load you can see a quick about me.

- The top left nav bar allows you to go to 'separate page'. This is possible by react routing, which is fake routing essentially and allows a user to go to specfic pages on page load, instead of starting at the about me every single time the page reloads.

- In my Contact Me page I have a form that will warn users of incorrect inputs in the form and when filled in correctly, they are told so.

- The resume route brings you to a page that allows you to download my resume and shows the languages I am proficient in.

- The portfolio page shows previous works I have finished, the languages assosciated with them, their links to the deployed site, and their githubs links

- Lastly, I stlying touch I did was placing my github and linkedIn links on the left of the page, allowing for ease of access. Putting them as a footer made the formatting have too much space
